# Sanju Site (Node/Express)

This project serves the existing static site files in this folder using a minimal Node.js + Express server.

Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm start
# then open http://localhost:3000
```

Notes
- The server serves files from the project root (HTML, `css/`, `js/`, `images/`).
- To run with automatic reload during development: `npm run dev` (requires `nodemon`).
- To change port: `PORT=4000 npm start`.
